## 中文介绍

我目前是密歇根大学安娜堡分校的电气工程与计算机科学硕士研究生，专注于计算机视觉与机器学习方向。在研究生期间，我曾在莱斯大学的Lei Li教授实验室参与基于多视角光声成像的神经网络优化项目，成功将仪器扫描的图像分辨率提升至原来的十倍。此外，我还参与了动物酮症风险预测的研究项目，运用长短时记忆网络（LSTM）进行建模，这些项目都显著提升了我在深度学习模型方面的研究能力。

本科期间，我就读于诺丁汉大学计算机科学专业并获得一等荣誉学位。在学术科研之外，我也在多家公司积累了实践经验，曾在零下五度信息技术有限公司担任电子商务软件工程师实习生，通过分析后端框架与重新设计系统架构，帮助工程师们减少了70%的查询时间。此外，我还在宁波智能研究院的研发团队中，担任过全栈工程师一职，和项目组员共同开发了“思雅”智能化妆镜，用户可以选择将系统推荐或自己上传的视频投屏至化妆镜内，方便用户在化妆的时候面部镜像对比。

我对AI算法、大数据以及计算机视觉领域充满热情，期望在搜索推荐、深度学习等方向继续探索和贡献。

## 英文介绍

I am currently a master's student in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, focusing on computer vision and machine learning. During my graduate studies, I worked as a research assistant in Dr. Lei Li's lab at Rice University, where I contributed to the optimization of neural networks for multi-view photoacoustic imaging, achieving up to a tenfold resolution enhancement for instrument-scanned images. Additionally, I participated in a project predicting the risk of ketosis in animals using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, which greatly improved my expertise in deep learning.

I earned my bachelor's degree with First-Class Honors in Computer Science from the University of Nottingham. Besides academic achievements, I have accumulated hands-on experience through various internships. As an e-commerce software engineering intern at Minus Five Degrees Information Technology, I reduced engineers' query time by 70% by analyzing backend frameworks and redesigning system architecture. Additionally, I worked as a full-stack engineer in the research and development team at Ningbo Institute of Smart Technologies, where I co-developed the "SiYa" smart makeup mirror. Users could cast system-recommended or self-uploaded videos onto the mirror, allowing for facial comparison while applying makeup.

I am passionate about AI, big data, and computer vision, and I am eager to continue contributing to the fields of search and recommendation systems as well as deep learning.
